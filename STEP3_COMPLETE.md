# Step 3 Complete: Advanced Inventory Management System

## 🎉 **STEP 3: BUSINESS-WIDE INVENTORY - COMPLETED!**

### ✅ **What We Built**

## 📊 **1. Business-Wide Product System**
- **Products now belong to Business** (not individual shops)
- **Shared inventory pool** across all business shops
- **Shop-specific stock allocation** via `ShopInventory` model
- **Flexible stock distribution** - Business admins control allocation

## 🏪 **2. Shop Inventory Management**
- **`ShopInventory` Model**: Tracks stock per shop per product
- **Smart stock levels**: min/max/reorder points per shop
- **Stock status tracking**: adequate, low_stock, out_of_stock, overstocked
- **Real-time inventory updates** with stock movement tracking

## 🔄 **3. Stock Transfer System**
- **`StockTransfer` Model**: Complete inter-shop transfer workflow
- **Transfer States**: pending → approved → in_transit → completed
- **Permission-based approval**: Business admins approve transfers
- **Audit trail**: Who requested, who approved, when completed
- **Stock validation**: Prevents transfers of unavailable stock

## 🎯 **4. Smart Business Logic**

### **Product Management**
```ruby
# Business-wide products with shop allocation
product = business.products.create(name: "Rice", ...)

# Check availability across shops
product.total_quantity_across_shops  # => 500 kg
product.quantity_in_shop(warehouse)  # => 300 kg
product.shops_with_stock            # => [warehouse, outlet]
```

### **Shop Inventory Operations**
```ruby
# Stock management per shop
inventory = shop.shop_inventories.find_by(product: product)
inventory.stock_status              # => 'low_stock'
inventory.can_fulfill_quantity?(50) # => true/false
inventory.restock(100, notes: "Weekly delivery")
```

### **Stock Transfer Workflow**
```ruby
# Initiate transfer between shops
transfer = StockTransfer.create(
  product: product,
  from_shop: warehouse,
  to_shop: outlet,
  quantity: 50,
  reason: "Outlet running low",
  initiated_by: worker
)

# Business admin approval
transfer.approve!(business_admin)  # Changes status to approved
transfer.complete!                 # Moves stock between shops
```

## 🗄️ **5. Database Structure**

### **Updated Tables**
- **`products`**: Added business_id, removed shop_id, added stock defaults
- **`shop_inventories`**: New junction table for shop-specific stock
- **`stock_transfers`**: Complete transfer workflow tracking

### **Key Relationships**
```ruby
Business → has_many :products, :shop_inventories, :stock_transfers
Product → belongs_to :business, has_many :shop_inventories
Shop → has_many :shop_inventories, :incoming_transfers, :outgoing_transfers
ShopInventory → belongs_to :shop, :product, :business
```
